# Mobile Store Simulation (Java Console Project)

This is a simple Java console-based simulation of a mobile phone store. It demonstrates basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts including classes, objects, encapsulation, and file handling.

## 🚀 Features

- Add and view smartphones
- Add and manage customers
- Simulate phone purchase by customers
- Automatic EMI calculation if customer can't afford the phone
- Store transaction records in a text file
- Menu-driven interface using `Scanner`
- Clean OOP structure with `ArrayList`, exception handling, and modular design
